Week 1:

Project idea: Image analysis with machine learning on images of microglia to determine activation levels.

I’m also very interested in training two neural networks to compare the activation to see if there is anything quantifiable about the weights that are usually described quantitatively in biology research.

I have the project idea but hadn’t met with my advisor to discuss it before our first meeting. Decided to start researching the idea in more detail. So I started writing a paper. I haven’t worked with images of microglia and I don’t know much about them so I started there. Here is the introduction I wrote and some snippets of the background information I wrote.

Introduction:
Microglia are a type of glial cell that serve as the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). They play a critical role in maintaining the health and function of the CNS, including maintaining the balance between neuroprotective and neuroinflammation. (Colonna and Butovsky, 2017, and Wake, 2011) In recent years, there has been growing interest in the role of microglia in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. However, the methods for understanding morphology and behavior of microglia have been shown to be limited and inconsistent (Green et al, 2022). While there are promising new developments in deep learning for the classification of microglia, the behavior of these networks remains elusive. This paper aims to provide an overview of methods for microglia classification using deep learning, as well as to propose several methods of network analysis to improve and draw additional conclusions about the morphology of microglia.

Function of Microglia

Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and play a critical role in maintaining the health and function of the CNS. They are involved in a wide range of functions, including immune surveillance, phagocytosis, synaptic pruning, and regulation of inflammation (Wake, 2011).

One of the primary functions of microglia is immune surveillance. Microglia are constantly surveying the CNS for any signs of damage, infection, or other abnormalities (Ukpong B Eyo, Long-Jun Wu, 2019). They use their long, thin processes to interact with neurons and other glial cells, monitoring the activity of the CNS and detecting any changes that may indicate a threat. When microglia detect a potential threat, they become activated and migrate to the site of the injury or infection to investigate further (ibid).

Once activated, microglia can perform a variety of immune functions. One of the most important of these functions is phagocytosis. Microglia are able to engulf and digest cellular debris, dead cells, and foreign pathogens, helping to clear them from the CNS. This function is critical for maintaining the health of the CNS, as the accumulation of debris or dead cells can lead to inflammation and tissue damage (Brown and Neher, 2014).

Microglia are also involved in the process of synaptic pruning, which is important for the development and maintenance of neural circuits. (Paolicelli et al. 2011) During early development, the CNS produces an excess of synapses, which are gradually pruned back to create more efficient neural circuits. Microglia play a key role in this process by engulfing and eliminating unwanted synapses. This function is important for maintaining the proper balance of neural connections in the CNS and ensuring optimal neural function (ibid).

In addition to their immune functions, microglia are also involved in regulating inflammation in the CNS. (Wake, 2011) Inflammation is a natural response to injury or infection, but excessive or prolonged inflammation can lead to tissue damage and neurodegeneration. Microglia are able to produce a variety of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which help to modulate the inflammatory response and prevent tissue damage. (Colonna and Butovsky, 2017) They can also interact with other immune cells in the CNS, such as T cells and B cells, to coordinate the immune response and limit damage to healthy tissue.

Microglia are also involved in a number of other functions, including regulation of blood flow in the CNS, production of growth factors that promote neural survival and regeneration, and modulation of neural activity (Ginhoux and Garel, 2018). They play a critical role in the development and function of the CNS, and are important for maintaining the health and well-being of the nervous system.
